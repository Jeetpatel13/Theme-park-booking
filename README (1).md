# Theme Park Booking

A full-stack web app for browsing theme park rides and booking ride time slots. Built with Node.js, Express, and SQLite, with session-based authentication.

## Features

- **User accounts** — register and log in with a hashed password (bcrypt) and server-side sessions
- **Ride catalog** — browse all rides with descriptions, duration, and minimum height requirements
- **Ride time slots** — each ride has multiple bookable time slots
- **Booking system** — logged-in users can book a ride time slot, view their bookings, and cancel them
- **Protected dashboard** — `/dashboard` and all booking routes require an active login session
- **SQLite storage** — rides, ride times, users, and bookings are persisted locally in `themepark.db`

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express 5
- **Database:** SQLite3 (via `sqlite3`), with Mongoose listed as a dependency for potential MongoDB support
- **Auth:** express-session (server-side sessions), bcryptjs (password hashing)
- **Frontend:** Static HTML/CSS/JS served from `public/`

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd theme-park-booking
npm install
```

### Running the app

## Notes

- This project uses a hardcoded session secret in `server.js` for local development — replace it with an environment variable (see `.env`) before deploying anywhere public.
- `themepark.db` is created automatically on first run; delete it if you want a completely fresh database.
